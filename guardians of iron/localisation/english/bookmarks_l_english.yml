 CAPTURE_NAME:0 "The Capture"
 CAPTURE_DESC:0 "It has been 853 years since the reign of King Hoole. In recent decades, the Guardians of Ga'Hoole seem to have retreated to their island, and the majority of the owl kingdoms have forgotten them. To the southwest, in the Canyonlands, Skench and Spoorn have consolidated power and are kidnapping owlets. However, it is said that a much greater danger lies within one of the Other's castles in Ambala.."
 KOG_CAPTURE_DESC:0 "The Guardians of Ga'Hoole have largely isolated themselves from the outside world in recent years, leaving thier existance to be mere legend. The spirit woods and the surrounding areas have been claimed by Ga'hoole as a chaw training ground, but with owls already avoiding the area, their activities are barely talked about, passed from ear slit to ear slit like some myth."
