 AGG_moonblinking_desc:0 "To ensure the Dyad remains forevermore, a policy of moonblinking every owl and owlet that comes to St. Aggies has been instituted. In this moonblinked state, owls are unable to feel or act on their own. This has advantages in battle as they appear unconcerned with pain or potential death, but leads to a near total brain-drain, as almost all info must be known by the Dyad before it is divulged."

(ahem) helps owlets who have fallen (or are at risk of falling) by bringing them to the Academy and making them compliant and able to reach their full owlness. In the beginning, of course, there are those that are... less than willing to adhere to the Academy's policies."
